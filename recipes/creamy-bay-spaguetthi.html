        <p> <em>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy.</em></p>
        <p>I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound bay scallops</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>â…“ cup dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, divided</li>
            <li> Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1</b>
              <p>  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package. 
             </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 2</b>
                <p>
                Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 3</b>
                <p>
                Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic.
                </p> 
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 4</b>
                <p>
                Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute. 
            </p>
             </li>
        
            <li><b>Step 5</b>
                <p>
                Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice. 
            </p> 
            </li>

        
             <li><b>Step 6</b>
                <p>
                Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute. 
            </p>
             </li>

             <li><b>Step 7</b>
                <p>
                Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls. 
            </p>
